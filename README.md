my implementation of [nand2tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/), a project where you build a 16 bit computer from the ground up, starting with a NAND gate.

A journey begins!!

the whole course/project material is available at https://www.nand2tetris.org/ and its absolutely free!, so you too can join this journey.

shout outs to [Noam Nisan](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~noam/) and [Shimon Schocken](https://www.shimonschocken.com/) for providing us this incredible oppportunity to learn.

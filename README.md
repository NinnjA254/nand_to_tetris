my implementation of nand2tetris(https://www.nand2tetris.org/), a project where you build a 16 bit computer from the ground up, starting with a NAND gate.

A journey begins!!

the whole course/project material is available at https://www.nand2tetris.org/ and its absolutely free!, so you too can join this journey.
